Head.js.wp Plugin
=================

A plugin to load all footer scripts with [head.js](https://github.com/headjs/headjs).

Details
-------

This plugin loads the scripts and styles enqueued in footer with the head.js loader. 

Head.js.wp assumes that scripts are loaded via `wp_enqueue_script()` and that any script enqueued in the `<head>` intends to be loaded before the rest of the page.
